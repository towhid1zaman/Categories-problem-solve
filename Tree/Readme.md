Basic Properties of trees:
- One Connected Components
- No Cycle
- If there are N vertices, then there will exactly N-1 Edges
- Every edges is a bridge, becasue if we remove any of this edges the connected components will be increase
- After removing edges , all connected components are still trees, then we called it "Forest"
