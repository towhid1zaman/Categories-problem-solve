Consider an array:

  {1,2,3,4}

- Subarray: contiguous sequence in an array i.e.

  {1,2},{1,2,3}

- Subsequence: Need not to be contiguous, but maintains order i.e.

  {1,2,4}

- Subset: Same as subsequence except it has empty set i.e.

  {1,3},{}
  
  Given an array/sequence of size n, possible

- Subarray = n*(n+1)/2

- Subseqeunce = (2^n) -1 (non-empty subsequences)
- Subset = 2^n
